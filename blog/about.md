Hello World! I'm Rick.

I've worked in the software industry for over 30 years, and have been messing with computers and
programming for close to 40. I've seen all kinds of changes, and gone through many re-inventions
of myself and my skillset during that time.

I think this gives me a good perspective to talk about the past, present, and future of computing
and software engineering. So that's what this is all about.

I'll explore computer languages new and old, test out ideas, dabble in retro-computing, discuss 
important lessons I've learned over my career, and detour into whatever rabbit holes might be 
of interest to explore.

I hope you'll join me and find what I have to say and show interesting and perhaps even valuable.
