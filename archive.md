## [My Journey](series/my-journey.html)

I explore my history in software development and engineering from the very beginning to the present day.

## [Challenge](series/challenge.html) 

I tackle something new (to me) and document my process to learn that new
thing and produce something interesting and/or useful (again, to me).

## [VICE's Vexing VKM](series/vice-vkm.html)

I explore the VICE Keyboard Mapping file, used in the VICE emulator for Commodore 8-bit computers.
